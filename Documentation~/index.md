# About the Asset Manager

The Asset Manager is an In-Editor tool that allows you to browse and import individual assets directly into your project. This package will add a new dockable window where assets are displayed and interacted with.

This package is available as an experimental package, so it is not ready for production use.

## Known Limitations

* The Asset Manager will only search for complete words
