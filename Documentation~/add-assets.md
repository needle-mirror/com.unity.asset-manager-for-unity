# Add a Unity Cloud asset to your project

> **Important**: Before you get started with the package, make sure you meet the [prerequisites](prerequisites.md).

## Importing an asset

There are different ways to import an asset into your project:
* Import button
* Context-menu action

### Import button
While in the Asset Details view, clicking on the import button will download all of the selected asset's files into your project at the default location.

### Context-menu action
You can right-click on any tile to bring up the contextual menu.  
Click on the import action to download all of the selected asset's files into your project at the default location.

### Import location

All imported assets will be saved under `Assets/Asset Manager` folder, which will be generated automatically by Asset Manager on the first import.

## Re-importing an asset
You can also re-import an already imported asset. This will download all of the selected asset's files into your project at the default location, overwriting any existing files.

## Show files in project
An imported asset will list out all of the files that were downloaded into your project with a status icon in the asset's details view. A folder icon means that the file was imported into the project.  
You can also use the kebab menu (three vertical dots) to see the "Show in project" option available and quickly find the file imported in the project browser window.
