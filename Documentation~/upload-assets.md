# Upload assets to Asset Manager

### How to upload assets to Asset Manager from the Unity Editor.

---

The Asset Manager for Unity package enables you to upload assets to Asset Manager. You can use this feature to:

- Upload all related asset files and their dependencies to preserve the assetsâ€™ data integrity.
- Share and reuse your game ready assets between different Unity projects and team members. This helps you reduce the cost of asset creation for your project and get the maximum value for an asset.
- Easily manage asset dependencies between Unity editor and Unity Cloud.

> **Important**:
Before you upload assets to Asset Manager, make sure you meet the [Prerequisites](prerequisites.md).

- Right-click and select **Upload to Asset Manager** or drag and drop from Project Window to Asset Manager.

- You can also select the [collection](https://docs.unity.com/cloud/en-us/asset-manager/basic-concepts#collections) you want to upload your asset to. This is optional.

    - **Ignore already uploaded assets:** Skip assets already uploaded to Asset Manager in Unity Cloud.
    - **Override existing assets:** Replace the existing assets with updated versions.
