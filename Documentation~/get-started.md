# Get started

<!-- Notes from product:

* Connect Asset Manager Project to Unity Project
* Open Asset Manager Integration
-->

> **Important**: Before you get started with the package, make sure you meet the [prerequisites](prerequisites.md).

The Asset Manager for Unity package introduces a new editor window that allows you to browse Unity Cloud Assets directly in the editor.

## Opening the window

After the package is installed, a new option will appear in the `Window` menu called `Asset Manager`, which will open the Asset Manager for Unity window.

## Verifying project settings

Your Unity project will need to be linked to a Unity Cloud organization that has access to the [Asset Manager service](https://dashboard.unity3d.com/asset-manager).  
To do this, open the `Project Settings`, `Services` tab and either create a new Cloud Project ID or select an existing one.
